 - Crysis 1.2 Mod SDK

### Build Instructions

#### Preparation:
- Install CMake
- Download source code from this GitHub repository and unpack it somewhere

    - open CMake, select directory with source code, select build directory
    - `Configure`
    - select your version of Visual Studio in the list of generators
    - select build features
    - `Generate`
    - `Open Project`
    - select *Release* build in Visual Studio
    - build solution
    - repeat all above steps for 64-bit version using Win64 Visual Studio generator

- Using Windows SDK only:
    - open Windows SDK command prompt
    - run `cmake-gui` in the command prompt
    - select directory with source code and build directory in CMake
    - `Configure`
    - select **NMake Makefiles** generator
    - select build features
    - `Generate`
    - move to the build directory in WinSDK command prompt
    - run `nmake` in the command prompt
    - repeat all above steps for 64-bit version using x64 Windows SDK command prompt
